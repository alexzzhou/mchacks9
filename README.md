# GIRAFFE Train Visualizer: A Rail Schedule Optimisation Solution

GIRAFFE is a simple railway optimisation solution for the RailVision Mchacks Challenge. It uses a pre-set algorithm 
as a highly efficient solution in a highly specific manner, but can also be applied in a variety of passenger traffic models. 
Use the tools offered by GIRAFFE to extensively test and visualize our algorithm.

This project is a collaboration between Gary Zhang, Alex Zhou, Faith Ruetas, and Felipe Lazcano.

## Getting Started

Use files found under testing to test a given train schedule on a passenger schedule with tester.py, and use trainVisualizer.py alongside to visualize. 
The tester is designed incrementively.

## Documentation

Documentation is coming soon. 

## Upcoming Changes

We are constantly looking to improve our algorithm. In the meantime, look out for QOL improvements for the visualizer.
